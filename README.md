Web Scraping Project — Global GDP & Real GDP Growth Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on web scraping economic data from **Wikipedia** using **Python**, **BeautifulSoup**, and **Pandas**.  
The extracted datasets include:

- **GDP Nominal** by Country
- **Real GDP Growth Rate (%)** by Country

The data is cleaned, processed, and stored in **Excel with multiple sheets**, making it useful for data analysis and visualization.
